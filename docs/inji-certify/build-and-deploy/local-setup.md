# Local Setup

Inji Certify enables an issuer to connect with an existing database to issue verifiable credentials. It assumes the source database has a primary key for each data record and information required to authenticate a user (e.g. phone, email, or other personal information). Issuer can configure their respective credential schema for various types of certificates they wish to issue. Certificates are generated in JSON-LD as per W3C VC v1.1.
