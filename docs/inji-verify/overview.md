In each scenario, Inji Verify leverages QR codes embedded with verifiable credentials to ensure secure and efficient verification across diverse sectors and applications.

**Key Components of Verifiable Credentials:**

1. **Credential Metadata:** Includes essential properties like the credential identifier, expiry date, and issuer information, all cryptographically signed by the issuer.
2. **Claims:** Immutable set of claims made about the credential subject, such as employee number and job title.
3. **Proofs:** Utilizes cryptographic methods to verify the data source and ensure data integrity.

**Importance of Interoperability:** Interoperability is pivotal in the realm of Verifiable Credentials, enabling seamless verification across diverse systems and organizations.

**Usage of Inji Verify:**&#x20;

Inji Verify offers a comprehensive set of features tailored to meet the verification needs of both users and relying parties:

* **QR Code Scanning:** Users can easily scan QR codes embedded within documents using their devices.
* **QR Code Uploading:** Alternatively, users can upload QR codes or documents which has the QR code printed on them for verification, providing flexibility in the verification process.

**Verifiable QR Codes:**

Verifiable QR codes employ digital signatures to guarantee the authenticity and integrity of the data they contain, offering heightened security measures. They are commonly used for sensitive information such as personal identification details, financial records, medical data, etc.

#### **PixelPass Integration:**

The PixelPass library now supports decoding CBOR-encoded QR codes, ensuring compatibility with Inji Verify for seamless verification through the portal.

#### **Device Requirements:**

To ensure successful verification, devices used for scanning QR codes must meet specific requirements:

* The device must have a camera with a minimum resolution of 12 megapixels and be capable of capturing images with at least 1020p quality.
* Disabling of visual effects and enhancements during scanning.
* Compatibility with internet browsers that support the device's camera.
* Scanning should be performed in a well-lit environment without any filters or dark mode settings.

#### **QR Code Version Compatibility:**

For successful verification using the scan feature, the verifiable credential (VC) should be encoded in QR code versions 27 and below. More details on QR code compatibility can be found in the Functional Overview Section \[here]\(Link to the Functional Overview Section).

#### **Conclusion**

Inji Verify stands as a powerful solution for authenticating and verifying verifiable credentials encoded in QR codes. With its user-friendly interface and robust features such as QR code scanning, uploading, and support for CBOR-encoded QR codes through PixelPass integration, Inji Verify ensures secure and reliable credential verification across various industries.
