# Overview

Partners are external entities or organisations who offer products or services to ensure the effective implementation and operation of MOSIP-based identity systems.Partner Management Portal (PMP) is a web based application that is designed to facilitate the collaboration and integration of external partners in the MOSIP ecosystem. This portal serves as a central platform to onboard all types of MOSIP partners, manage their details and build partner specific functionalities for seamless interaction.
