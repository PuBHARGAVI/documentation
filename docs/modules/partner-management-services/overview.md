# Overview

## Partner Management Portal

Partners are external entities or organisations which offer products or services to ensure the effective implementation and operation of MOSIP-based identity systems.&#x20;

Partner Management Portal (PMP) is a web based application that is designed to facilitate the collaboration and integration of external partners with the MOSIP ecosystem. This portal serves as a central platform to onboard all types of MOSIP partners, manage their details and build partner specific functionalities for seamless interaction.
