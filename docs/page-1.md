1. What are Verifiable Credentials (VCs)?

A [verifiable credential](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#dfn-verifiable-credential) can represent all the same information that a physical [credential](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#dfn-credential) represents. Adding technologies such as digital signatures can make [verifiable credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#dfn-verifiable-credential) more tamper-evident and trustworthy than their physical counterparts. In short, VCs are secure digital certificates that can be verified cryptographically. They represent identity documents, degrees, or other trusted information.
