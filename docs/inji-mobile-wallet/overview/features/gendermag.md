## What is GenderMag?

The **GenderMag Methodology** aims to analyze and mitigate gender biases in users’ problem-solving interactions with software. It underscores the importance of accounting for gender differences in human-computer interaction (HCI) during the software design process.

1. We identified three personas based on their familiarity with technology and their ability to embrace technological progress. The personas are:
   
   * Abi, who is either Abigail or Abishek, is 45 years old. He works as a homemaker, is literate, but not very tech- 
    savvy. His internet connectivity is moderate, and he does not have a personal phone.

   * Tim, who is either Timothy or Timara, a 24-year-old financial consultant, is literate, tech-savvy, and boasts 
     excellent internet connectivity. Additionally, he owns the latest phone.
